# Azure Resource Launcher
I've made this project a series of deployment scripts out of a need for having an Azure configuration environment ready to test with.
Considering that we also need to keep Azure credit costs low, the environment resource groups are meant for deletion after each use.

## Before you use
The scripts can be run from a terminal console with the built-in `sh` command for MacOS or Linux.
For Windows Client, the .sh scripts can be opened directly if you have Git installed for Windows Client.
